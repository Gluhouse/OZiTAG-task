# OZiTAG-task


I tried making this work with given HTML, but without groups / nesting it seems almost pointless to try and come up with solutions.
Making a simple optgroup / even a regular div inside div would be much faster than trying to make this work.


Possible style solutions

1) Make an absolute div inside div*x(maxLevel - 1) with borders + padding + margins to make the dashed line and then position it inside the select (Not very smart)
2) To make top select only display x options from the select seems impossible, would have to create a separate block for that (w.i.p)
